    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cyber Detectives</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: 12/07/2023</p>

    <p>Thank you for using the Cyber Detectives Chrome Extension. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose information obtained through your use of our extension.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Usage</h2>

    <h3>Collected Information</h3>

    <p>Cyber Detectives does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. The extension only accesses the link of the site you are currently visiting to perform a security check.</p>

    <h3>Site Link</h3>

    <p>The primary functionality of Cyber Detectives involves retrieving the link of the current site and determining whether it is malicious or benign. This link is processed locally within the extension, and no data is transmitted or stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>We take the security of your information seriously. The link retrieval and security check are performed locally on your device without transmitting any data to external servers. We do not store or log any user activity.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>Cyber Detectives does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs for link processing. All operations are self-contained within the extension.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes via the extension or our website. It is recommended to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
